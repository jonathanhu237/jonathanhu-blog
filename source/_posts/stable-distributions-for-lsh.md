In the previous post, we discussed that LSH addresses the $c$-NNS problem by solving multiple $(R,c)$-NNS problems using different radii. In this article, we will explore how to construct LSH families specifically designed to solve the $(R,c)$-NNS problems under the $\ell_p$ norm, leveraging the properties of $p$-stable distribution.
